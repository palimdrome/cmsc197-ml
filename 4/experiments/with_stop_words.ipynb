are not taken to represent the sheer physical capacity to take damage it would be absurd that a human of any level could take as much raw damage as a dragon i treat the hit possessed at first level as the raw damage potential of now although it is possible to give a mortal stroke to an unresisting opponent your fighter presumably does not intend to give himself a mortal wound but to show off his raw damage potential hence figure damage as normal but take it out of the hit he had at first level you could figure it as doing maximum damage but then it would have the randomness which it like roulette a test of courage let see i have hit left to damage and a dagger which does in essence if the character to show off let him show off but not without risk then you see how brave he really is

people only have about actual hit and the rest are skill in avoidance deity favor for this same reason you can kill a sleeping person in one blow no damage need be rolled they are automatically dead

would be interested in this one loop ca loop i not sure what loop is waiting for i have yet this loop is waiting for either going high which that the routine can send data to the egret chip or it for a shift register interrupt in this interrupt of cause will never because it get somewhere in void i why are we setting the flag this is the vier enable interrupt as there are several coming in from the egret chip kind of timer tick every second the chip to be before new but due to the lost interrupt there chip will never be loop is waiting for an interrupt on see above i through the code and found that that is in is not properly some can be found at furthermore when i force the hanging egret routine ca to enter the interrupt routine it at because is not possibly at so there is lots of fun to be going through the code but i will follow both in parallel an direct if you do mind i put the last mail you sent to me in there somewhere and this message too should be i hope apple wo sue me

elm version walter from walter walter subject re to date met from at elm version hi dan walter will disable the specific interrupt my understanding of walter line above is that it the interrupt flag to walter acknowledge the interrupt i will look into the manual of walter the via this evening to be sure i check it it is correct actually the are supposed to be by calling a chain of at this to a pointer to which is just the code should the device table but the device handler code does get under the scheme until after and is set to be for both the mouse and the by did that make sense i do think we want the device handler for both and mouse to be does that mean that the only thing we need is an interrupt routine which incoming from the chip and it to that is essentially what does if i am not mistaken if so it should not be to big a problem starting from the think c program of cause there is some work to be done to change the routine from polling to interrupt operation furthermore we would possibly lose the address resolution capability of more than one keyboard or mouse could then be a problem walter from what i have seen there are walter at least three to walter which will be sent one after the other and one or two walter to accept received i have to bring my walter and write it down for you here is what i found so far base address length of first send string pointer to first send string length of second send string pointer to second send space left in receive buffer see index to receive buffer see length of second receive buffer pointer to second receive buffer base

yesterday i out the reset of the flag in the which is found in and the call to egret with set to whenever the is after running through the routine i get the panic second which us two it is the timer tick the egret chip because this timer tick is as a very normal egret chip to message just like the so no need to twiddle with i then had trouble with register being which program execution to continue at which is not a good thing probably have to save some before calling the egret looking again through the code the one brad to i think that these might be sufficient to get the via egret code to run perhaps there is no need to check the code further i will look into these further this evening but i think we are very close walter if you happen to catch the looping in the egret code

yesterday i got through the routine on my though there are some left i took some of the code from main problem was the missing at into see below and got through the code my are all marked with a comment starting with and a date as the from the table in low memory every second from the egret code i the corresponding to give only a colon so do panic when you see on your screen it only you that the egret is alive if there is no use for this interrupt it should be by a instruction what remains unclear at the moment is why i only get through when with defined doing this about to supervisor traps to egret and finally several trap from give it some time on my terminal this around on the display around two due to poor speed after the from it then list the keyboard and mouse then at was there something broken in the of the current kernel around of when i last the kernel or is there still something wrong with the stuff when the without the only thing i get is the colon every second from the timer tick but after a minute i still do get the from might this be a timing problem the message some to print on the terminal perhaps we need some delay before repeatedly calling the egret

it own extended keyboard and internal video walter and i have been working on this for some time walter made a strategic breakthrough but i have the joy of seeing it finally work walter got it through but there were still some really today i it until it was useful but the code is still very gross and i do really know why it works exactly more work is it an extra half page of while booting but it works after that but for those of you who want a working kernel on a machine please try and let me know if you have any success this probably will help as well as and any other machine with similar to the it will probably not work on other if you know your are like the it probably not worth the effort since i really have to start working on my classes and walter is going on vacation we probably wo work on this stuff for a little while if anyone else to look at it the file all the key you need to compile with defined for it to work and there are some print in in which should be out low level stuff from wed received from by id wed received from by with id wed received by via id for wed received from snake by id wed from received by snake id wed subject low level stuff to walter date wed mailer elm revision from subject low level stuff to walter date wed mailer elm revision walter and dan and and brad too i have been poking around in the lower of the and have found some information which may be useful the routine some low memory global to be set as we well know although right now these are set up by that direct call from the setup i thought a cleaner setup might be after going through and almost all of the routine in i am getting a better understanding of how the whole thing works here are the low level that are used by normally pointer to the process next section of the code this is repeatedly after the initial command is sent normally always this is set to point to to the routine that actually send the command to the hardware normally always this is set to point to this must be set because of the routine or the code reference this this word value a delay value for use when the to a to the chip its value is divided by to obtain the delay value on a it is usually this is a pointer to storage space for the command that is currently working on the storage space needs to be at least long but i have not exhaustively this the space itself like it does not need to be any special way before calling this is if bit is set it the machine a style chip being that a mac this must be set for the based to work this is something like it is not used for the themselves but it used by the and if then the use instead of the older serial interface and i have that all the old now use i am in the process of out how to access all the different and how to encode them properly my first happy discovery is sending to the chip the current clock value from the clock chip itself since this can be used to set the kernel clock setting at boot time note that this is a command you send egret for all the call the egret routine directly they do not call i have also been working on the code that walter sent about writing to the chip directly i now have a reliable that can read and write to the chip on a machine without going though the i need to clean them up a little however before they are finished it would not be too difficult to mimic the style such as and make them call these i do not know if this direct is the way to go since the stuff is basically working but i have been enjoying learning how the whole thing works regardless i plan on this code up somewhere soon so it is to those who are interested i will let you know when and where senior engineer phone walter to from walter wed walter received from by id wed received from by with id wed received from walter by id wed from walter walter subject to to date wed met from at am elm version walter from walter walter subject to to date wed met from at am elm version hi here comes the up version of which hopefully only the minimal to get the egret chip of running it is based on the version of on the file date is marked were made by those marked are by me walter walter we had some very discussion with who currently works on a hardware approach to the egret stuff that he to the egret chip directly via the rather than via the code doing this he recently found the to read the hardware clock and to shut down the machine he to be the one who the knowledge of what the egret chip can do the kernel i currently work with this i have tested whether the break something on other by the way the video works again so do bother to look into the stuff to the found in the source tree are void was made silent as it is every second by the egret probably there should be a dummy routine just for the timer tick by a jump through address and the other seven in the fake dispatch table should remain on the verbose version on void frame frame dan included a variable which statement whenever the routine in the is through the which in fact exactly once on my never ask why this works but dan it wo work without these or with only one of them void some the machine are to found on the and and some other in low memory are to zero does this the vector table used to handle traps and so on at a command word is which is used very early while speaking to the egret chip void if on a machine do fiddle with interrupt but call the routine in the the entry point i used calling in the and the already memory instead this routine up the memory in and should this entry point eventually be in the machine dependent vector while writing this i see that there is still some work to do as i will be away for two week from never the less i send you these for further testing on older and perhaps to include it

sufficient randomness have more fundamental in security in particular secure require two a secure protocol to communicate over untrusted and code at both the latter problem received less attention but security regardless of the quality of the or of the random we have a series of related we can spoof to patch on the fly if we are on any between the client and server we used this to turn legitimate into that used a fixed key known only to us thus invisibly security the same trick us to defeat security by we can also spoof so that we can replace any file such as with another file that with root access even if the user can not these work because the path to is really not trustworthy in most although we use to compromise the client can also be during by of or and could also patch the client after it on the local disk especially on like that do not provide access control for given that these are realistic we believe that these must be resolved before security and commerce are realistic we to consider in more detail some fundamental of common network security that would lead to trivial further on as well as many other security like it was our goal to demonstrate that it is trivially possible to patch to completely compromise their security in doing so we hope to reinforce the point that security is an problem that is far harder than getting the correct strong correct only make more subtle more likely especially in light of the potential for financial gain as the amount of commerce on the most of the we discuss are suitable for the systematic exploitation of large of an entire organization or even a large fraction of the user base of a particular piece of in many a pool of common like the binary are provided to by a in such and there is no authentication of the file contents sent between and in these there are for sophisticated access to determine file at open or handle time but the file contents that are read from the server are not in any secure way the client no way to determine if the are indeed being sent by the server our first attack model is one in which the attacker promiscuous network access to any machine on any between the and the under attack in under a day we produced that can exploit the lack of authentication in to patch the object code of any executable as it between the server and the client machine the technical of the attack are rather simple to retrieve data from the server a client a short request message which block from the file it is interested in where a block is a range of the attack is on an segment between the client and the server so is able to snoop this traffic the attack waiting for any request for a particular block of a particular executable for example the block the generation code in the executable it is then able to forge a reply from the server and transmit it to the client if the forged packet the client before the legitimate reply it is accepted and the legitimate reply is as a duplicate there is obviously a race condition between the injection of the forged response and the true response since the is solely on this task while the is certainly from many it a very good chance of winning the race we have that the the race a large fraction of the time given this ability it becomes possible to compromise the security of any executable loaded from the network we have the executable and the code that the session key by only we were able to cause the selection of a predictable session key every time the browser in the protocol it is then trivial to snoop and all traffic from the browser to secure credit card or other private information since this is really an attack on the client it is not limited to the browser on the contrary it is extremely widely applicable an appropriate patch to the executable possible the compromise of any by and therefore all of the authentication provided by in many our own here at all the application are from an server this a major flaw in security as our attack file or is useless if the integrity of the executable can not be most easily by it from local disk however making local of crucial is not sufficient in the face of a more serious set of on the attack the can be as before in a position to snoop to the server as issue a request the can return the handle to a different executable and also forge its by tricking into code that is root unlimited access to the client can be easily it is possible to mount so that root will not be by the client still the can make arbitrary succeed and substitute a of some sort the attacker could cause of commonly executed to appear to succeed or could spoof other that are by the operating system for example the user file is a natural and easy target from which to leverage further damage this that it is unsafe to execute any program via an insecure channel to an server no matter what the privilege level of the client user neither is it limited to or in particular based on rather than are just as vulnerable it is possible to hijack although it is somewhat more complicated based on traffic coming from the distribution site of popular is also possible for example is a mirror site for the browser any student with promiscuous network access on a machine between the server and the main link to the could have similar to patch the huge number of of the binary that were from more mundane based on or remain viable today these must exploit some other weakness in a system security to infiltrate but once in place they can perform to local to fully compromise a system previously such were mostly only by ego or malice it is now more valuable to compromise a client invisibly so that the user the system is secure thus unlike traditional the new will aim to have no visible effect on the system thus making them difficult to detect and easy to spread unintentionally our patch of this flavor we realize that it is impossible to eliminate all security one can always question whether it is safe to trust the hardware or whether outside used for communication of public or are truly secure fortunately in practice it should suffice to handle far less than all of these we hope to have one gaping hole in practical security today and to have the problem of the there is one simple step that we can suggest that would go a long way towards improving the security of increasing the practice of widely cryptographically secure of their would be extremely helpful a small amount of paranoia and care must be applied to the used in the verification process a floppy disk would be appropriate to hold the verification for example we are concerned that security on and is currently insufficient when real money is at stake security must withstand greater scrutiny in summary protecting the channel

in the united basic rate interface and primary rate interface we currently offer three of service on business and home on measured residential each of these provide digital transmission from our central office to a with digital rather than transmission receive communication capability for the transmission of circuit switch voice and data and packet switched data these are currently used by to access conduct send and receive electronic mail service is as a permanent category service offering for business and home for measured residence are as provisional category i all three of these are

enable our to better reflect our in providing the we request that the for business and home for residence be made permanent this would eliminate the provisional nature of the service we also request that the for home and be to personal and business this will eliminate customer contusion as to the use of each service these are to assure that better reflect its and that such are marketable and attractive to rate background we are to because two of our in our original tariff filing have proved inaccurate when were initially were structured on the best information capital and expense available at that time we now have information actual capital and expense from providing service to approximately the first assumption is the of more than from the serving central office our original of the would be more than from the central office these reflected that many of the were centered closer to wire in more metropolitan our current which are based on actual use indicate that of business and of home are more than from the central office furthermore our indicate that the of more than from the serving central office will increase as demand for and access the second assumption is the amount of night and weekend usage by home home currently have unlimited local usage during night and weekend time daytime local usage is billed at measured service the monthly recurring price for home was designed to cover the cost of approximately of local usage each month and all other in actual practice the majority of are under of usage each month however a minority of apparently are their usage on and all weekend long this in an overall average of of night and weekend local usage per home customer per month our analyses show that our current will not sustain our this will harm both ourselves and our the must increase in order to better reflect our to provide rate with this application we propose to make the following to the basic rate price the monthly recurring will be by per month for the for additional of local use for home and business will be from to per minute for daytime usage from to for evening usage and from to for usage the current offer to waive installation for a year term agreement will and the current unlimited local usage option for home will be capped at per month price the current charge for the four most popular optional will be these will be automatically as part of the basic feature package volume and term related will be a new toll discount plan will be to meet the needs of this is based on our analysis of the and incremental of providing for the next five these incorporate process and favorable from our equipment as above the also reflect our estimate of the incidence of dense and remote demand for the service and actual usage to assure that better reflect during the next five our monthly recurring price for should be by the charge for additional of local use for home and business should be as noted above the current term related waiver of installation should be the current termination to me two year will be for term and a hour free local usage cap should be added to home service there are compelling to make these price now without these service in the aggregate will continue to be under priced there are approximately this number is to increase to during the next five if do not better reflect will create a

interested in i use it to practice that i write almost daily for my you can check it out from my exam page at or put the following form on one of your web to call the program yourself substituting your own preferred default directory and form post input hidden input hidden file input submit file one problem i in this program is that the owner of the is daemon rather than myself so either the directory to be by daemon or have global write does anyone know a way around this other than the file after the program works well as is for my current but the ownership problem setting up a little

o p s i guess i too fast to that last question i tried the program and it is easy to set up i the program several ways tried the touch inside the program tried to an and then the plus a couple of other basically what i found is that when the program is used to the file it any creator information prior to the execution of the script becomes daemon sorry for the dos by such as and millions of

tried the touch inside the program tried to an and then the plus a couple of other basically what i found is that when the program is used to the file it any creator information prior to the execution of the script becomes daemon it not hard to change the ownership after the fact though a command leaves ownership the same but the user the owner of the copy a simple program could change ownership via a single command the only problem is leaving global write access to the directory though this could be before and after another solution is to have the daemon create the directory it will be so that only it write then use web to do all the manipulation by next semester i have a practice exam question editor running that can use to add practice to web and this will be my obvious solution that way the web program is what can and ca be done and i doubt anyone will go to the trouble to write a web program specifically to do damage to my but any valuable should have backup elsewhere just to be
